# Hotel_Booking_Prediction_System

 Logistic Regression is a classification problem. It will predict either true or false. For prediction of Binary Classification logistic regression rarely used.  
 
 In this project I'm going to predict whether the hotel is booked or not by the guest using Logistic Regression and some other important library like pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, plotly and so on.  Pandas is used to read the csv file and for analyzing the data.
 In order to clean, analyze, explore and manipulating the data pandas is rarely used. 
 
 Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
 Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant. Relevant data is very important in data science.  
 
 
 Numpy stands for numeric python and is rarely used for arrays. NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
